🌍 Task 3 – Artificial Intelligence Chatbot  
Rule-Based Chatbot Console App using Java (Task 3 – CodeAlpha Internship)  

This project is developed as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship (November 2025)**.  
The goal of this task is to build a **Java console-based chatbot** that interacts with users using simple rule-based logic.

---

📌 Project Objective  
- Create a chatbot using Java that can interact through text input.  
- Implement rule-based responses using conditional logic (`if-else`).  
- Allow real-time communication in the console.  
- Demonstrate simple artificial intelligence using keyword detection.  

---

🧠 Core Functionality  
- Accept user input continuously via console.  
- Identify key phrases such as greetings, questions, or farewells.  
- Respond with pre-defined text or system-generated information.  
- Handle unknown queries gracefully with a default response.  
- Terminate the chat when the user types "bye".  

---

💬 Example Conversations  
🤖 Hello! I’m CodeAlpha Chatbot.
Type 'bye' anytime to end the chat.

You: hi
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

You: what is the time
Bot: The current system time is 18:04:57.234512

You: what is the date
Bot: Today’s date is 2025-11-03

You: bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day 👋

---

🧪 Workflow  
1. Program greets the user and prompts for input.  
2. User enters queries (greetings, time, date, etc.).  
3. Bot processes text and matches keywords.  
4. Replies using simple rule-based conditions.  
5. Conversation continues until “bye” is entered.
